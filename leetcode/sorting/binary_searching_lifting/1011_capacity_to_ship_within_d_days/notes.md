# Review Notes

1) A capacity on each shipment does not need to be full, only the day restriction matters.
2) The upper and lower bounds is important. For the lower bound we require `max(weights)` so that we can ship the largest package in a single day. For the upper bound we require `sum(weights)` to ship all the packages in a single day.
